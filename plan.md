The task is to create a modern, responsive eCommerce website for Al Fazl Perfumes using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The website will include a homepage, product listing page, product detail page, shopping cart page, contact page, and a responsive navigation bar. The design will reflect a luxurious and traditional feel appropriate for an Arabian perfume brand.

### Step-by-Step Outline of Changes

#### 1. **Homepage (src/app/page.tsx)**
   - Create a hero banner with the brand name "Al Fazl Perfumes" and a tagline.
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure a modern and elegant look.
   - Add a placeholder image for the hero section.
   - Implement a grid layout to showcase featured products.

   ```tsx
   const heroImage = "https://placehold.co/1920x600?text=Al+Fazl+Perfumes+Hero+Banner";
   ```

#### 2. **Product Listing Page (src/app/shop/page.tsx)**
   - Create a product listing component that fetches and displays dummy product data.
   - Each product should include an image, name, description, and price.
   - Use the `ProductCard` component for individual product display.

   ```tsx
   // Example product data structure
   const products = [
       { id: 1, name: "Perfume A", description: "Description A", price: 50, image: "https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Perfume+A" },
       // Add 5 more dummy products
   ];
   ```

#### 3. **Product Detail Page (src/app/product/[id]/page.tsx)**
   - Create a dynamic route to display product details based on the product ID.
   - Include a larger image, detailed description, and an "Add to Cart" button.
   - Ensure the layout is responsive and visually appealing.

   ```tsx
   const productImage = "https://placehold.co/800x600?text=Perfume+A+Detail";
   ```

#### 4. **Shopping Cart Page (src/app/cart/page.tsx)**
   - Implement a shopping cart context using `CartContext.tsx` to manage cart state.
   - Display items in the cart with the ability to view and remove items.
   - Include a summary of total price and a checkout button.

#### 5. **Contact Page (src/app/contact/page.tsx)**
   - Create a contact form with fields for name, email, and message.
   - Use React Hook Form for form management and validation.
   - Style the form using Tailwind CSS for a clean look.

#### 6. **Navigation Bar (src/components/Navigation.tsx)**
   - Implement a responsive navigation bar with links to Home, Shop, About Us, and Contact.
